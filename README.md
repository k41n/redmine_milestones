redmine_milestones
==================

This plugin adds milestone entity in Redmine (http://www.redmine.org/).

Milestones can be created either inside versions or connected to project itself.

Milestones have actual/planned start and due dates. Actual dates are calculated based on
issues connected to milestones.

Milestones can be hierarchically included one into other, thus making possible to create aggregate milestones, joining
submilestones and issues from different projects.

Developed in 2012 by RedmineCRM (http://redminecrm.com)
